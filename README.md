hey! I am a developer with background on computational physics. I also like to make some games in my spare time. 

  - Python, C/C++, Go, TypeScript, SQL, and other languages. 
  - Backend development (REST APIs, databases, CLI tools, containers, linux).
  - High-performance, distributed and parallel computing.
  - I also like to do some frontend dev with React, NextJS, and sass.
