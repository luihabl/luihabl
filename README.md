hey! I am a developer with background on computational physics. I also like to make some 
games in my spare time. I am mainly into:

  - 📓 Python, C/C++, Go, TypeScript, SQL, and other languages. 
  - ⚙️ Backend development (REST APIs, databases, CLI tools, containers, linux).
  - ⚡️ High-performance, distributed and parallel computing.
  - 🔮 Some frontend dev with React, NextJS, and sass.
